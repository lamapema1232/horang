	Xavier International College has a well-equipped library with a wide range of books, journals, and reference materials that are relevant to the A-levels curriculum. Xavier 

	International offers a wide collection of materials, books, and other media that are accessible to students in physical and digital forms. In Xavier International, the library occupies a prominent position and it is an important and integral part of the teaching program. We have materials arranged
	

 in a specified order according to a library classification system so that items can be located quickly and collections may be browsed efficiently. Our academic library serves the students and faculty to provide support in research, consultancy, and resource linkage for students and faculty. Our library offers workshops and courses outside of formal, graded coursework, which are meant to provide students with the tools necessary to succeed in their programs. Our workshops provide

students with skills that can help them achieve success in their academic careers (and often, in their future occupations), which they may not learn inside the classroom. The academic library provides a quiet study space for students on campus; it also provides group study space. Our main objective and function of the library are to provide resources necessary for research in the field of interest, to help the teacher in keeping abreast of development in their field, to open the door to the world of books that lie beyond the borders of one's own field of specialization for the success of all formal programs at Xavier International. The library also provides access to online resources and e-books.</p>

<p style="width: 80%">Technology-based teaching is becoming increasingly popular as it allows students to learn and study in a more interactive and engaging manner. Here are some ways that technology is being used in coaching institutes to enhance the learning experience:

1. Digital learning solution: We use a comprehensive digital learning solution that includes videos, animations, and interactive simulations. This technology-based learning solution enables students to learn at their own pace and provides a personalized learning experience.

2. Concept-Based Videos: We use concept-based videos to teach students complex concepts in a simplified manner. These videos are designed to explain concepts and theories visually, making it easier for students to understand and retain information.

3. Interactive Whiteboards: Interactive whiteboards are also used in. These whiteboards allow teachers to present complex information visually and engage students in interactive learning activities. Students can also collaborate and participate in group discussions, making the learning experience more engaging and interactive.

4. Online Learning Platforms: It offers online learning platforms that provide students with access to study materials, practice tests, and video lectures. These platforms allow students to learn at their own pace and provide a flexible learning experience that fits their individual needs.

5. Online Test Series: We conduct online test series for competitive exams. These online test series simulate the actual exam environment, allowing students to practice and gain confidence before the actual exam.<p><br><br><br>

The hostel provides laundry services that are managed by a trusted vendor who handles the laundry services on behalf of the hostel.

Their presence provides a sense of security and support to the students, creating a conducive living environment.
The hostel offers additional classes conducted by experienced faculty members or qualified tutors. These classes provide academic support and guidance to students, focusing on specific subjects or helping them with challenging topics.
